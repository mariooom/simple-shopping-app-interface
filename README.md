# Simple Shopping App Interface
This project demonstrates how to build a responsive UI using Flutter. The application features a sign-up page and a stateful home page with a horizontal scrollable layout containing multiple sections: a page view for products, a grid view for product cards, and a list view for hot offers.

# Features

- Input their name, email, password, and confirm password.
-  Validate input fields with detailed error handling:
- Name must start with a capital letter.
- Email must contain an "@" symbol.
- Password must be at least 6 characters long.
- Password and confirm password must match.
- View and hide passwords using a toggle button.
- Submit the form to create an account and navigate to the home page.
- Includes a success dialog upon account creation.
3. Responsive Design
