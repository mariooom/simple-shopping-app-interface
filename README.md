# Simple Shopping App Interface
This project demonstrates how to build a responsive UI using Flutter. The application features a sign-up page and a stateful home page with a horizontal scrollable layout containing multiple sections: a PageView for products, a GridView for product cards, and a ListView for hot offers. Additionally, the app includes smooth fade animations for seamless transitions between pages.

# Features
1. Sign-Up Page
A fully functional Sign-Up Page that allows users to:
- Input their name, email, password, and confirm password.
- Validate input fields with detailed error handling:
- Name must start with a capital letter.
- Email must contain an "@" symbol.
- Password must be at least 6 characters long.
- Password and confirm password must match.
- View and hide passwords using a toggle button.
- Submit the form to create an account and navigate to the home page.
- Includes a success dialog upon account creation.
- Fade Animation: After confirming the dialog, the sign-up page fades out while the home page fades in, creating a smooth transition.
2. Responsive Design
- Utilizes MediaQuery to ensure the UI adjusts dynamically to various screen sizes.
3. Home Page
Contains multiple horizontally scrollable sections:
- Our Products: Displays a PageView for browsing product images.
- Product Grid: A responsive GridView displaying product cards with images, text, and an "Add to Cart" button. Includes a Snackbar notification for adding items to the cart.
